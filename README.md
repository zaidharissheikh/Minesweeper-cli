# Minesweeper-cli

The following repository contains C++ code for the game Minesweeper. It includes comprehensive comments with each function to assist in understanding the code better. While the code is somewhat lengthy, it is one of the simplest versions you'll find on the internet. I spent a considerable amount of time developing this game and ensured it handles most exceptions. You can either play this game for fun or use the code for an upcoming project. Hope this helps! :)
