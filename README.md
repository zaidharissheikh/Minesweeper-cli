#Minesweeper-cli
The following repository contains c++ code for the game Minesweeper. It contains all the necessary comments with each function assisting in the better understanding of the code. The code is somewhat a little lengthy but is one of the most simple ones that you'll ever find on the internet. I spent a considerable amount of time making this game and made sure it handles most of the exceptions, you can either play this game for fun or even copy the code if you have an upcoming project.
Hope this helps! :)
